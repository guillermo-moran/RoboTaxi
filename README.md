RoboTaxi
-----
Transportation  as a service

It is an application similar to Uber that simulates ordering, deploying, and moving "phantom" vehicles around a city.

It works with any city it's put in, as long as there's a vehicle on the map (anywhere).

With a little more work, RoboTaxi could function with real vehicles, provided that it has GPS and internet capabilities.

Unfortunately, the backend is written in PHP and MySQL. The iPhone app is written in Swift, and can be adapted for a new API.
